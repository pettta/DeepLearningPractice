============== Running the program / Program Info ==============
- You should be able to navigate to /keras_equivalent and do "python test.py" to run it 
- I varied the string optimizer_name between "rmsprop", "adagrad" and "adam" to achieve the results in the paper 

==============Issues ==============
Major Issue: I was not able to get it to work with pure numpy. I know this will destroy the grade of the subjective quality opinion,
but I figured it would be better to have results than no results. I tried to implement with numpy, but unfortunately due to time restraints and
being alone was unable to. Guess this is what I get for being overambitious and trying the section we barley covered.
