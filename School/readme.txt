============== Running the program / Program Info ==============
- layers.py is imported by all of the following files and contains the classes needed for them to work
- hw5_part2.py corresponds to section 2 of the writeup: a basic artificial neural network, it uses early termination, so the graphs a little funky 
- hw5_part3.py corresponds to section 3 of the writeup: a MLP that demonstrates overfitting 
- hw5_part4.py corresponds to section 4 of the writeup: adjusting the MLP to counter overfitting 
- You can verify the results of the writeup by running python (or python3 depending on os) <filename>
- Make sure that the MNIST datasets are next to all of the files to ensure that everything works properly

============== Potential Issues ==============
- training time for part 3 and part 4 are going to take a while 
- ran into some issues with divide by zero in part 4 at one point when I set the learning rate too big, I think those issues are gone though
