============== Running the program / Program Info ==============
- Make sure that the mcpd_augmented.csv file is in the same directory as hw1_part5.py since it opens that assuming they are next to each other
- layers.py is imported by all of the following files and contains the classes needed for them to work
- hw1_part3.py corresponds to section 3 of the writeup: inputting X for all of the different layers
- hw1_part4.py corresponds to section 4 of the writeup: doing a forward pass through input->fully connected->logistic sigmoid 
- hw1_part5.py corresponds to section 5 of the writeup: doing a sample observation of an actual dataset through the same forward pass 
- You can verify the results of the writeup by running python (or python3 depending on os) <filename>, The only one that should change is part 5 since it has non-seeded random weights and biases.
