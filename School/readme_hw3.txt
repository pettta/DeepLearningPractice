============== Running the program / Program Info ==============
- layers.py is imported by all of the following files and contains the classes needed for them to work
- hw3_part2.py corresponds to section 2 of the writeup: the visualization of gradient descent from the theory question
- hw3_part5.py corresponds to section 5 of the writeup: testing a linear regression architecture 
- hw3_part6.py corresponds to section 6 of the writeup: testing a logistic regression architecture 
- You can verify the results of the writeup by running python (or python3 depending on os) <filename>
- Make that the medical dataset is next to the part5 file, and the kidcreative dataset is next to the part6 file to ensure that they work properly 

============== Potential Issues ==============
- Couldn't manage to get linear regression to work as well as I wanted as you can note by the values I got in the writeup:
	for that I wrote a little more info at the top of the part 5 python file, but the general gist from what I can tell is that it seemed to not 
	decrease fast enough to go into the minima, and possibly jumped it, but that might not be the case, and maybe there was some other 
	stupid mistake causing it.
