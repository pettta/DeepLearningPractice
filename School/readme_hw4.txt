============== Running the program / Program Info ==============
- layers.py is imported by all of the following files and contains the classes needed for them to work
- hw4_part2.py corresponds to section 2 of the writeup: the visualization of the weights vs objective function 
- hw4_part3.py corresponds to section 3 of the writeup: seeing how model initialization affects convergence
- hw4_part4.py corresponds to section 4 of the writeup: seeing how momentum affects convergence
- hw4_part5.py corresponds to section 5 of the writeup: testing a simple case of ADAM optimization  
- hw4_part6.py corresponds to section 6 of the writeup: testing a ADAM with MNIST on an actual architecture
- You can verify the results of the writeup by running python (or python3 depending on os) <filename>
- Make that the MNIST datasets are next to the part 6 file to ensure that everything works properly
